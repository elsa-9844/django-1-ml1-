ml algorithm (drug classifaction) 
This project is focused on drug classification using multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective model for accurately categorizing drug types. A dataset was used to train and evaluate several classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. Each modelâ€™s performance was tracked and logged using MLflow for better experiment management and comparison. After identifying the best-performing model, hyperparameter tuning was performed to further improve accuracy and generalization, ensuring the model was protected from overfitting and underfitting. The final model was integrated into a user-friendly interface built with Django, allowing users to input data and receive drug classification results along with accuracy metrics. This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from model selection and tuning to deployment with a web-based interface for real-world usability.
